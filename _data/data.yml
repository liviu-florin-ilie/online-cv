career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a  seasoned (15+ years) Software Developer who lives by this: 
      \"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are\". 
      This allowed me to perform in different company cultures, different team setups 
      and also ever changing tech-stacks. Worked as a full-stack developer developing 
      software in Java, Groovy, Python, Scala, SQL, Swing, JSP, JavaScript, Angular.
      Built production ready software for various industries and end users:
        - Mobile Gaming in the Payments Area
        - Financial Sector
        - eLearning
        - Title search
        - Task Management
      I was also involved in configuration of CI pipelines involving WebSphere application
      servers and internal CI tools. I am a creative, resilient, open and helpful person.
      I worked with great people who helped me grow both my technical and soft skills.
      
      This is my take on software development:
      The software developer nowadays has to fill in different roles: he can
      be a fireman when something \"catches fire\", he can be an archaeologist
      when there is no handover or even a private detective when there are
      things he needs to accomplish his tasks and has to look for the people
      that can provide help. Sometimes one can act as a translator as there
      are things that not all people can understand. One can even be the
      housekeeping lady when everyone else is avoiding it. He must be a
      teacher in order to share  what he has acquired. And sometimes he can be
      what he is destined to be: an architect and a builder.

          The team in the Payments department builds and maintains payment integrations 
          between our core systems and different payment providers and payment methods 
          which enables the player to deposit and withdraw his money in a smooth way. 
          My role lies within the cards stream which deals specifically with the card 
          payments integrations. Our aim is to lower the cost of the price per payment, 
          expand our current payment methods and lower the fraud risk for the payments. 
          As a member of the Card stream I was involved in building one of our integrations 
          and the rule engine used to build rules for risk and fraud mitigation.
          
          Tech Stack: A microservices architecture built over an inhouse SpringBoot-ish framework

          I am involved in building tools that help automate certain tasks in our department.
          Built a web app that automated the monitoring and deployment of our 20+ Blaze instances 
          by integrating with GitLab and Artifactory external systems. This app increased the happiness 
          of our colleagues in charge of the release of new versions and eased the process of monitoring
          our instances during high season. Tech stack for this app: Angular, Groovy, Servlets, MongoDB.

          Was involved in creating a web-app that would help our colleagues overview and verify the suspect 
          transactions. Tech stack for this app: Angular, Groovy, Servlets, MongoDB. I rewrote and enhanced 
          an existing automated testing framework that allows our developers to test their code against 
          expected results.
          Also managed to integrate SSO functionality into our webapps using Waffle.

          Worked on different "Pricing engines" for our Unicredit colleagues from Italy. The most 
          important one was GPT (Global Pricing Tool) which we rewrote from a monolith build on a Java 
          tech stack to a microservice infrastructure with Scala for the microservices, Python for 
          the calculation engine, Hazelcast for caching data, and Angular for the frontend. We also used SBT 
          for building the Scala microservices. We aimed to provide the users with a more pleasant experience 
          and we fully realized that by increasing the webapps speed and resilience. The microservices were 
          eventually deployed on Docker. 
          The team for this project consisted of a technical analyst, business analyst and six developers. 
          We worked in an Agile way.  

          For 4 months I contributed on a migration of a crucial application, BUL-Batch platform/Calculation 
          engine to a new server infrastructure. The tech-stack had EJB2.0, JMS, WebSphere 5 and 8.
          
          I rearchitected Fund Transfer Price - Batch platform/Calculation Engine with an open-source 
          tech-stack: Spring Batch, Spring Boot, MyBatis, Vaadin, but using the previous Teradata database. 
          For deployment we used Jenkins and but our modules on Docker. Took it to MVP level.
          
          Also had a small role in Exonus project which was built with Spring Cloud infrastructure.

          I worked on different projects in eLearning area. The projects I worked on, were LMS (Learning 
          Management Systems)/LCMS (Learning Content Management Systems). Their aim was to help students and 
          professionals to acquire new knowledge and skills in certain areas. The platforms supported going 
          through online courses, they could measure the progress and also assess their knowledge. There were 
          three different kind of frameworks that I worked on, which had different tech-stacks:
           - Hibernate, Spring, Struts 1, MySQL, BIRT, Tomcat
           - Hibernate, Spring, Spring MVC, MySQL, JSP and jQuery, Tomcat
           - Struts, Hibernate, MySQL, JBoss
