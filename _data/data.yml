    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a  seasoned (15+ years) Software Developer who lives by this: 
      \"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are\". 
      This allowed me to perform in different company cultures, different team setups 
      and also ever changing tech-stacks. Worked as a full-stack developer developing 
      software in Java, Groovy, Python, Scala, SQL, Swing, JSP, JavaScript, Angular.
      Built production ready software for various industries and end users:
        - Mobile Gaming in the Payments Area
        - Financial Sector
        - eLearning
        - Title search
        - Task Management
      I was also involved in configuration of CI pipelines involving WebSphere application
      servers and internal CI tools. I am a creative, resilient, open and helpful person.
      I worked with great people who helped me grow both my technical and soft skills.
      
      This is my take on software development:
      The software developer nowadays has to fill in different roles: he can
      be a fireman when something \"catches fire\", he can be an archaeologist
      when there is no handover or even a private detective when there are
      things he needs to accomplish his tasks and has to look for the people
      that can provide help. Sometimes one can act as a translator as there
      are things that not all people can understand. One can even be the
      housekeeping lady when everyone else is avoiding it. He must be a
      teacher in order to share  what he has acquired. And sometimes he can be
      what he is destined to be: an architect and a builder.
