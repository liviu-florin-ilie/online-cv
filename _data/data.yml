career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: 
      I am a  seasoned (15+ years) Software Developer who lives by this: "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are". 
      This allowed me to perform in different company cultures, different team setups and also ever changing tech-stacks. 
      Worked as a full-stack developer developing software in Java, Groovy, Python, Scala, SQL, Swing, JSP, JavaScript, Angular.
      Built production ready software for various industries and end users:
            - Mobile Gaming in the Payments Area
            - Financial Sector
            - eLearning
            - Title search
            - Task Management
      I was also involved in configuration of CI pipelines involving WebSphere application servers
      and internal CI tools.
      I am a creative, resilient, open and helpful person.
      I worked with great people who helped me grow both my technical and soft skills.
      This is my take on software development:
The software developer nowadays has to fill in different roles: he can be a fireman when something
“catches fire”, he can be an archaeologist when there is no handover or even a private detective
when there are things he needs to accomplish his tasks and has to look for the people that can provide help. 
Sometimes one can act as a translator as there are things that not all people can understand. One can even be the housekeeping lady 
when everyone else is avoiding it. He must be a teacher in order to share  what he has acquired. And sometimes he can be what he 
is destined to be: an architect and a builder.
